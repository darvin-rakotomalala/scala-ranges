## Scala | Ranges

The **Range** in Scala can be defined as an organized series of uniformly separated Integers. It is helpful in supplying
more strength with less methods so, operations performed here are very quick.

**Some important points**:

- The Ranges can be utilized by the for loops for iteration.
- It can be obtained using some predefined methods namely until, by, and to.
- It is defined by three constants i.e, (start, end, and increment value).

Syntax:

```
val range = Range(x, y, z)
```

Where, x is the lower limit, y is the upper limit, and z is the increment.

**Ranges are helpful.** They describe series of numbers. This makes calling functions on sequences easier and more
intuitive. With methods like to, until and by we form simple ranges.
